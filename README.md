## Project Structure

```
SamCars-BE/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js          # Main application file (Express setup & server)
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ userRoutes.js # User-related routes
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/      # Route controllers

### File Structure Explanation

The project uses a simple and straightforward structure with `index.js` as the main file that handles:
- Server setup and configuration
- Express application setup
- Middleware configuration
- Route definitions
- Error handling
- Server startup

This single-file approach keeps the codebase simple and easy to navigate while still maintaining a clean separation of routes and controllers in their respective directories.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- PostgreSQL
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vamsi-rebounz/SamCars-BE.git
   cd SamCars-BE
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development
   
   # Database configuration
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=samcars
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

## Running the Application

Development mode (with auto-reload):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Production mode:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 (or the port specified in your .env file).
